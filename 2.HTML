            <li>1 onion and 2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of garlic paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of coriander powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of garam masala</li>

            <li>Begin by washing and blanching the spinach. To blanch the spinach, bring a pot of water to a boil and add the spinach leaves. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes and then drain the water. Immediately transfer the spinach to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. This helps in retaining the vibrant green color of the spinach.</li>
            <li>Once the spinach has cooled down, grind it into a smooth paste using a blender or food processor. Set it aside.In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and add cumin seeds. Once they start to sizzle, add finely chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent. Add ginger and garlic paste to the pan and saut√© for a minute. </li>
            <li>Next, add finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy. Now, add all the spices - coriander powder, garam masala, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Mix well and let it cook for a minute.Add the spinach puree to the pan and mix well. Let it cook for 5 minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the paneer cubes to the spinach mixture and stir gently. Let it cook for another 5 minutes. Finally, add heavy cream and salt to taste. Mix well and let it cook for a couple of minutes. Your palak paneer is now ready to be served! Garnish it with some more cream and serve hot with rice or naan bread.
