            <li>10-12 small brinjals (eggplants)</li>
            <li>2 medium-sized onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons roasted peanuts, coarsely ground</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds, roasted and ground</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons desiccated coconut, roasted and ground</li>

            <li>2-3 tablespoons oil</li>

            <li>Gently stuff this mixture into the brinjals, making sure not to break them. Heat oil in a pan and place the stuffed brinjals in a single layer. Cover and cook on medium heat for 10-12 minutes, turning them occasionally until they are tender.</li>
            <li>n the same pan, add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown. Add in the remaining stuffing mixture and cook for a minute. Now, carefully place the cooked brinjals on top of the onion mixture and cover the pan. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until the flavors are well blended.</li>
            <li>Gutti Vankayya is ready to be served hot with steamed rice or roti.
            </li>
